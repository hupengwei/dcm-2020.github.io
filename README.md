## IJCAI 2020 Workshop: Disease Computational Modeling

This workshop will be held in conjunction with [IJCAI 2020](https://www.ijcai20.org/) in Yokohama, Japan.

### Introduction

In recent years, AI technologies have been widely used to develop healthcare applications, e.g. computer vision for medical imaging, speech recognition for clinical voice assistant, natural language understanding for chatbots to answer frequently asked questions in medicine. A series of surveys and reviews report the state-of-the-art technologies special for deep learning methods used in healthcare [Esteva et al., 2019; Beam et al., 2018; Miotto et al., 2018; Xiao et al., 2018]. Furthermore, tutorials have been given in recent years at top AI conferences to help audience apply deep learning methods to healthcare applications with heterogeneous data [Choi et al., 2018; Liu and Sun, 2017].

Besides kinds of healthcare applications, there is still a huge space to uncover the disease-centric computational models, towards a better understanding of the course of a disease. For example, [Ahlqvist et al., 2018] used a data-driven cluster analysis of six variables to build 4 novel subgroups of adult-onset diabetes and their association with outcomes. Such new sub-stratification could change the way we think about type 2 diabetes and help to tailor and target early treatment to patients who would benefit most. Another example is the research work by [Sun et al., 2019] which built a probabilistic disease progression model for Huntington’s Disease (HD), and 9 disease states were identified with discovery of multiple potential HD progression pathways. [Makino et al., 2019] used a convolutional autoencoder for representation learning of electronic medical records to construct a predictive model for diabetic kidney disease. For mining disease-symptom relationships, [Xia et al., 2018] built a biomedical knowledge graph from MEDLINE/PubMed articles, and exquisite relationships of severe diseases were presented. For disease-drug studies, [Gottlieb et al., 2017] proposed to leverage causal inference to discover real-world evidence for 4 second-line drug classes of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Besides, [Ghalwash et al., 2019] proposed an ontology driven multi-task learning framework towards a more general embedding of medical concepts with patient visits.

### Topics

In this workshop, we wish to address the fundamental challenges of building disease computational models based on advanced AI technologies. This calls for methods that can discover:

-	biological association for disease genotyping; 
-	clinical representation for disease phenotyping; 
-	probabilistic graph models for disease progression;
-	disease-symptom models for screening or early diagnosis; 
-	disease-drug models for optimal care patterns;
-	embedding of medical concepts w./w.o. patient visits;

or other novel disease models that potentially put meaningful insights in healthcare.
