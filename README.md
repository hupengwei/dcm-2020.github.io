## IJCAI 2020 Workshop: Disease-Centric Computational Modeling

This workshop will be held in conjunction with [IJCAI 2020] (https://www.ijcai20.org/) in Yokohama, Japan.

### Topics

In this workshop, we wish to address the fundamental chal-lenge of building disease-centric computational models based on advanced AI technologies. This calls for methods that can discover:

-	biological association for disease genotyping; 
-	clinical representation for disease phenotyping; 
-	probabilistic graph models for disease progression;
-	disease-symptom models for screening or early diagnosis; 
-	disease-drug models for optimal care patterns;
-	embedding of medical concepts w./w.o. patient visits;

or other novel disease models that potentially put meaningful insights in healthcare.
